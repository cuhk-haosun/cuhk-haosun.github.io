## Welcome to Prof. Hao SUN's Bioinformatics Lab! 

  The main research interests of our lab is developing bioinformatics solutions for medicinal/biological problems. It is interdisciplinary in nature with a complement of experimental investigation. More specifically, we are focusing on applying computational algorithms and statistical methods on **Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)** and **Third Generation Sequencing (3GS)** data to: 
  
  **(1)** facilitate the development of novel diagnostic methods for the **Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD)**, 
  
  **(2)** decipher the **transcriptional regulatory codes** involving key transcription factors and non-coding RNAs in eukaryotic genomes by working closely with bench-scientists.

  Since the establishment of the lab in 2009, we had published more than 40 peer-reviewed papers in high profile journals, such as Science Translational Medicine, Genome Research, PNAS, EMBO Journal, Nucleic Acids Research, Cancer Research, and Bioinformatics. We have developed a series of algorithms for analyzing:
  
   **·**ranscriptome sequencing data (iSeeRNA & Sebnif suite, NAMS), 
   
   **·**bisulfite sequencing data (Methy-Pipe & BSviewer suite), 
   
   **·**lncRNA functional prioritization (LncFunNet & LncFunTK suite), 
   
   **·**noninvasive prenatal testing (FetalQuant, and FEMER), 
   
   **·**as well as other software (GeneCT, and ODS), 
   
   **·**and databases (YY1TargetDB, mTFkb, and SKmDB).

  In collaboration with clinical researchers and bench scientist, we used these algorithms to gain novel biological insights from various biological processes and facilitate the development of cutting-edge NGS-based molecular diagnosis methods especially in NIPD.
